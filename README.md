# compile-error-
Compile error due to incorrect preprocessor directive usage and result reference in printf function

check whether the # is missing in the start or if the syntax of the preprocessor directive is wrong.
"#include <stdio.h>" is the right header file to include. The system will find the file named "stdio.h" and read its entire contents in, replacing this statement.
